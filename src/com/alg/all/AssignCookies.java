/**
 *
 * Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
 But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a 
 cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to 
 the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the 
 maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.


Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
 * 
 
 The brute force solution will be to sort both arrays and assign the cookies with min value that satisfies the greed of a child.
 The maximum number in the child array that was satisfied will be the answer.
