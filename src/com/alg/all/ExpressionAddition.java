     * 
     * complexity of solution is O(n^2)+O(n)
     * 
     * Solution 2:
     * 1)scan all the terms in expression 1 and store the terms in hash with (key,value) as (exp, coeff)
     * 2)scan all the terms in expression 2 and update the terms in hash if already exist, or add if not already present
     * 3)Iterate for the key value pairs of the hash and get the final result as the sum
     * 
     * Complexity: O(n); Space: O(n) is worst, when there are no common exponents in the expressions
