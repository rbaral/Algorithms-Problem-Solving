/*
Your company runs an online video store, where customers can rent movies for online viewing.

All data of the video store website is available in a MySQL database called rentamovie, which you can explore and query.

Write a SQL query that retrieves repeated rentals in which the same customer rents the same movie more than once. Show only the movie's title and the customer's name, for example,

Groundhog Day	Robin Kostas
The Lady Eve	Julia Williams
The Lion King	Rebecca Smith
Vertigo	John Spencer
If a customer rents the same movie multiple times, the output should show this (movie's title, customer's name) combination only once.

Your query should be saved in /home/candidate/candidate_files/answer.sql. For your reference, you can find the DB schema description in /home/candidate/candidate_files/schema.txt.

Constraint: Your answer must contain only one SQL statement. For example:  Statement 1; Statement 2;           is not allowed whereas  Statement; is allowed, and may span over multiple lines.
