/**
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Example 1:

Input: 27
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: 9
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: 45
Output: false
Follow up:
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

	In particular, n is of type int. In Java, this means it is a 4 byte, signed integer [ref]. 
	The maximum value of this data type is 2147483647.
	Knowing the limitation of n, we can now deduce that the maximum value of n that is also a power of three is 1162261467.
	Therefore, the possible values of n where we should return true are 3^0,...3^19
	Since 3 is a prime number, the only divisors of 3^{19} are 3^0, 3^1,...,3^19.
	, therefore all we need to do is divide 3^{19}  by n. 
	A remainder of 0 means n is a divisor of 3^{19}â€‹  and therefore a power of three.
