/**
 * 
 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue)
* 
* 
 *
 * Solution 1:
 * 1)Create two stacks, assume s1 be the one which maintains queue order and s2 as a buffer
 * 2)when adding element, 
 * a) empty s1 into s2
 * b) add the  new element to s1
 * c) empty s2 to s1
 * 3)when dequeuing element, simply do pop on s1
 * 4) when doing peek, simply do peek on s1
 * 
 * Complexity: O(4n) as we have every element in stack pushed and popped twice
 * 
 * Solution 2:
 * 1)Just push every element into s1
 * 2)when we have to dequeue, empty s1 into s2 and pop from top of s2
 * 2 a) the push will be always on s1
 * 2 b) dequeue from s2, when s2 is empty transfer all items from s1 and again repeat the same process
 * 
 * 3) We can have a pointer point to the last inserted element and directly use it for peek instead of looking into s2
 * 
 * Complexity: O(n) - when s2 is empty we have to copy n elements from s1 before we can dequeue (pop from s2)
 * O(1) - when there is an item in s2, a dequeue simply needs a pop operation on s2
