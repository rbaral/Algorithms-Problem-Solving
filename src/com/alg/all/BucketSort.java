 *1) create bins, lets say, 0-9, 10-19, 20-29 and so on
 *2) divide the elements of an array into those bins. The elements go to the bin that has their range (e.g., 2 goes to 0-9, 15 goes to 10-19 and so on)
 *3) sort within the bucket/bin using any sorting algorithm
 *4) take the sorted elements from the bucket and we will have the whole array sorted
