/*
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items 
respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that 
sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 
You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).


Solution:
-we cannot use brute force approach of trying each and every items and check if the value is maximum
-sorting the items by thier values and taking the one with maximum value might work for some cases but
not for all set of weights and values (here the greedy approach fails), if we were allowed to take fraction of items
then the greedy approach would have worked instead
-we can use dynamic programming as it has many overlapping subproblems
-for every item, we check if this item fits in the knapsack and including it increases the value
