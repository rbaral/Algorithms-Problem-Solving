/**
 *Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffleâ€”in other
words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that
you are given a random number generator which is perfect.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Solution 1:
 * Let's imagine our n-element array. Suppose it looks like this:
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
Using our Base Case and Build approach, we can ask this question: suppose we had a
method shuffle ( . . .) that worked on n - 1 elements. Could we use this to shuffle
n elements?
