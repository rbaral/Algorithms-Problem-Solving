	In particular, n is of type int. In Java, this means it is a 4 byte, signed integer [ref]. 
	The maximum value of this data type is 2147483647.
	Knowing the limitation of n, we can now deduce that the maximum value of n that is also a power of two is 1073741824.
	Therefore, the possible values of n where we should return true are 2^0,...2^30
	Since 2 is a prime number, the only divisors of 2^{30} are 2^0, 2^1,...,2^30.
	, therefore all we need to do is divide 2^{30}  by n. 
	A remainder of 0 means n is a divisor of 2^{30}â€‹  and therefore a power of two.
