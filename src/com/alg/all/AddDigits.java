/**
 *Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

* Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root
* 
* It helps to see the digital root of a positive integer as the position it holds with respect to the largest 
* multiple of 9 less than the number itself. For example, the digital root of 11 is 2, which means that 11 
* is the second number after 9. Likewise, the digital root of 2035 is 1, which means that 2035 âˆ’ 1 is a multiple of 9. 
* If a number produces a digital root of exactly 9, then the number is a multiple of 9.
With this in mind the digital root of a positive integer n may be defined by using floor function as
 dr(n)=n-9*( {n-1}/{9}).
